TRON (TRX) Now Has 2 Million Users
Apart from an increase in dapp activity on the Tron blockchain, the number of user accounts has also increased exponentially. The hyped cryptocurrency project now has 2 million mainnet accounts, which took only 249 days from the launch of Tron’s mainnet.
Highlighting this achievement was Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX) who pointed out that it took just 181 days to reach their first 1 million users and only 68 days to reach another 1 million, which is 3 times faster than the first 1 million user achievement.
Sun shared his excitement of this major milestone over Twitter, where he asked his large following of over 915,000 followers how long it will take Tron to reach 3 million users.
